# Queues_Simulator

Main objective
  Design and implement a simulation application aiming to analyze queuing based systems for determining and minimizing clientsâ€™ waiting time.
  It should have a graphical interface through which the user can insert the simulation time, number of clients, number of queues and maximum and minimum arrival time and 
service time for each client. 
  The user should see the simulation steps in real-time. 
  The application should end when the simulation time ends or there are no more clients in the system and the average waiting time (how much time a client spends at the queue 
and in front of the queue in average), average service time and peak hour (the simulation time when there are the most clients in all queues) are displayed.
  These and the log of events should be saved in a text file.
